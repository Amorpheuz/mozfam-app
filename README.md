## The Onion Rooting

"Vegetable prices have surged by 33% in 2019", "After onions, potato prices jump 75% in Delhi", "60,000 suicides of farmers in Maharashtra as of 2014". There is a smokescreen here that lies over here. Middlemen keep crops in deep freezers and release them at a high rate when demand rises. We eradicate this problem with the help of a Blockchain network and an all transparent transaction that can be monitored and stop illegal storages of vegetables/crops. Our Web-App will help farmers sell crops at decent rates and will be a platform for them as well as Middlemen to buy/sell crops and can be regulated with the help of the government.
